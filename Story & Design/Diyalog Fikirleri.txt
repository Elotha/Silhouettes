Karanlýða çok yakýn bir silüet, etkileþime geçildiðinde þunu söyler:

"You can't run away from the flux forever. I tried."

SILHOUETTES:

"I don't believe I'm in the dark. I'm only here to observe those who dwell in darkness."

"At least we have each other." (3 kiþilik grupta)

"She is always here with me. Guiding me. I won't let her go." (ýþýðýn yanýnda yalnýz)

"Different times, different places... But the act is always the same. Some thinks that only they deserve to live."

"What you are doing, is it meaningful? Is it meaningless? Or is it about seeking the meaning itself?"

"Everyone wants to feel strong. Therefore, some of them choose the easiest way. And they judge the others, those walking on a harder path. Only to justify themselves."

"Mind is full of rooms. We choose which one to lock and which one to unlock. If you unlock them all, you unleash fear, and the truth about yourself."

"Everyone has a struggle inside them. A constant war between the what they want to be, and what the others want them to be. If you lose your ego, then you become a prisoner of the flux."

"Everything is meaningful in this world. Every object says something about this world and those who live in it. I'm exploring their depths to find myself."

"Just consume everything you can find here, death will nullify your search anyway."

"They say there is a secret that lies in the furthest east of the road." (Yeterince yoldan saða doðru yürürsek 'Sheep' baþarýmý alýyoruz.)

"Existence is pain."

FOUNTAIN:

Flux'a yakýn olan çeþmelerde:

"Curiosity becomes the knowledge, knowledge becomes the future."

"Experience brings the new decisions, for those who seek them."

"When everybody agrees, everybody is wrong."

"No ships reach their destination if there is no route."

"Point of views always vary whereas truth is sole."

"They all walk the same way but they never collide."

"You can get lost in a fog if you only trust your eyes."

"You cannot see its value as long as you have it."

"You cannot change the past, but it can change you."

"If there is no change, there is no evolution."

"Everyone dies twice. First, when they are light blue, second, when their legacy fades."


Flux'a uzak olan çeþmelerde:

"When the very first consciousness is shaped enough to interpret its surroundings, knowledge became reachable. It changed not only the acts of whoever holds it, but the next ones as well. Patterns revealed themselves, and when someone identifies one, taught the others. In time, patterns that not yet to be seen, remained ignored."

"Some thought their existence was only for what is existed. They brought nothing new but they preserved what is there."

"Their perception was blurry due to their prejudices. They did not accuse themselves or what is taught to them, instead, they denied the reality."

BENCH:

"You can always find someone here. Everyone experiences that moment when you feel you need a break or when your path is blurry. To see from the outside. What do you see?"

- Boundaries.
- A path.
- A choice.
- I'm not sure.

------

BENCH:

"All those people... They are too busy to see the other possibilities. Following the path that is shaped by the predecessors. Did you walk the same way in your life similar to the others?"

- I think so.
- I've had a unique way.
- I'm not sure.

------

BENCH:

"I question the skepticals. We can see what is ahead, then why risk it? Why not trust the predecessors? What do you think, a risky road or one with safe choices?"

- A risky road.
- A safe road.
- In between.
- I'm not sure.

-> A risky road.

"You follow passion, I guess."

-> A safe road.

"That's it."

-> In between.

"Now that is interesting. I never thought this as an option."

-> I'm not sure.

"Think carefully. You look you don't have much time left."

------

BENCH:

"I don't know how many times I've been here to watch they go. What do you call them?"

- Sheep
- Ordinary
- Normal
- Devoted
- I'm not sure.

------

SILHOUETTE:

"I have a story to share. Would you like to hear?"

- Yes.
- Maybe later.
- No.

-> Maybe later.

"Okay then, I will be around if you change your mind."

-> No.

"Okay then."

-> Yes.

"I've been told for many times, that I am walking on the wrong way. They said, "Why don't you trust the common consciousness?" They always thought happiness comes from being in the flux, walking through it. But in the end, their legacy only helped to restore some stones of the flux. Maybe add some new stones, at most, but that is all. Only so the next ones may be able to walk the exact same way. Doing the same things, saying the same words, judging the others as the way the predecessors did. I responded, "If there is no change, there is no evolution.". When you are inside, you see a continuous change. But if you look at it from the outside, the changes are always the same, like in a loop, therefore flux is stationary. And I had to see the other possibilities, even I would have to do it alone. Because that was my story, not theirs. And I never regret it. Remember, your story is yours, and yours only. Thanks for your listening, I really needed to share it with someone."

------

BENCH:

"People usually don't come here while in your state. I guess you still have some questions. Maybe I can share some advice with you, if you want?"

-> No.

"You want to deal with it alone, I guess. Good luck."

-> Yes.

"What makes us stronger, are our boundaries. We survive as a whole. If one pushes the boundaries too far, becomes seperated, becomes alone, and thus, helpless. The flux is not here to restrain us, but to keep us safe and whole. If we need a change, we change as a whole, just as water that finds its way. I hope this helps. Good luck."

------

SILHOUETTE:

"Are we here because of our free will or do we follow a deterministic way that we don't have any control on it? What do you think?"

- We have free will.
- Free will is an ilusion.
- I'm not sure.

------

SILHOUETTE:

"Do you think time to time, why we are here? Why do we exist?"

- No, actually.
- Yes, but I don't know why.
- Yes, and I know why.

-> No, actually.

"Leave the cave, someday."

-> Yes, but I don't know why.

"Me neither. Maybe we're here to think that, who knows."

-> Yes, and I know why.

"What do you think is the reason?"

- A god's wish.
- Causes-and-effects that led up to here.
- A creator, created this system and us.
- Our existence is based on our perception.

BENCH:

<E> tuþuna basýp konuþmaya çalýþtýðýmýz zaman:

"Leave me be, I am not in the mood to talk."

------

SILHOUETTE ONE:

"Are you familliar with the concept of illusion of choice?"

- Yes.
- No.

"Illusion of choice make you believe that you are making a choice, but actually outcome is either independent of your choice and always the same or you don't choose at all. Like the answer I just gave you. Because no matter what you choose, I was going to say the same sentence anyway. You believed that if you say no, then conversation would be going somewhere else and if you say yes then you would be hearing it. And your decision was based on what you have experienced so far, full of causes and effects that formed your interpretation for this question. Thus, you didn't choose anything at all. That is the illusion of choice. Since everything can happen only once in our timelines, you cannot go back and try the other choices to see if it would be different or not."

SILHOUETTE TWO:

"Knowing there is such illusion of choice and there is no free will make us scary. But I fear more of illusion of consequence, if such thing exists. In our world, everything exists with their contradistinctions. Where there is good, there is bad. Day becomes night, night becomes day. Shadows only exists when there is light as well. So, what if different consequences occured by different choices doesn't change the total? What if when someone chooses A instead of B, someone else chooses B over A, therefore world is going the same way overall? I hope this is not the truth."

------

SILHOUETTE:

"If you are looking for a meaning, go left."

Sola gidersek, tekrar karþýmýza çýktýðýnda:

"If you are looking for a meaning, go right."

Saða gidip kendisini tekrar bulup sorduðumuzda diyaloglar baþa sarar.

------

SILHOUETTE:

"If someone finds great happiness in their life, they question if it is a dream or not. If someone else see that person's great happiness, they tend to think that person is actually broken inside, so he or she is pretending. Noone seems to believe there is great happiness, then how can we achieve it? There is always a conflict and coexistence of opposite situations. Maybe the acceptance of the fact that we will always search for it but we will never fully have it brings us peace."

------

SILHOUETTE:

"There was once someone, heard a rumor about a tree. He never saw a tree before, nor he knew it exists in this world. He pursued the rumor, it gave him a purpose. He never find a tree, so he wanted to become a tree. When he died, still there wasn't any, but he formed the 'Light of the Tree", for those who seek for a it."

------

SILHOUETTE:

"I won't feel my absence when my existence come to an end. But I still couldn't make peace with it. Are you afraid of dying?" (sona yaklaþmýþ)

- No.
"Have you decided what your legacy will be?"
	- Not yet.
	"Yet you aren't afraid of it. Even when this close. I envy you."

	- Yes.
	"What is it?"
		- A reflection.
		- A light.
		- 
		"I hope I can find myself too, before it is too late."
- Yes.
"Yeah, me too. Knowing death is nigh even more worrisome. I'm just waiting."
