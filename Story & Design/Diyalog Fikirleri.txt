Karanlýða çok yakýn bir silüet, etkileþime geçildiðinde þunu söyler:

"You can't run away from the flux forever. I tried."

SILHOUETTES:

"I don't believe I'm in the dark. I'm only here to observe those who dwell in darkness."

"At least we have each other." (3 kiþilik grupta)

"She is always here with me. Guiding me. I won't let her go." (ýþýðýn yanýnda yalnýz)

"Different times, different places... But the act is always the same. Some thinks that only they deserve to live."

"What you are doing, is it meaningful? Is it meaningless? Or is it about seeking the meaning itself?"

"I won't feel my absence when my existence come to an end. But I still couldn't make peace with it." (sona yaklaþmýþ)

"Everyone wants to feel strong. Therefore, some of them choose the easiest way. And they judge the others, those walking on a harder path. Only to justify themselves."

"Mind is full of rooms. We choose which one to lock and which one to unlock. If you unlock them all, you unleash fear, and the truth about yourself."

"Everyone has a struggle inside them. A constant war between the what they want to be, and what the others want them to be. If you lose your ego, then you become a prisoner of the flux."

FOUNTAIN:

Flux'a yakýn olan çeþmelerde:

"Curiosity becomes the knowledge, knowledge becomes the future."

"Experience brings the new decisions, for those who seek them."

"When everybody agrees, everybody is wrong."

"No ships reach their destination if there is no route."

"Point of views always vary whereas truth is sole."

"They all walk the same way but they never collide."

"Everyone dies twice. First, when they are light blue, second, when their legacy fades."

"You can get lost in a fog if you only trust your eyes."

"You cannot see its value as long as you have it."

"You cannot change the past, but it can change you."

"If there is no change, there is no evolution."


Flux'a uzak olan çeþmelerde:

"When the very first consciousness is shaped enough to interpret its surroundings, knowledge became reachable. It changed not only the acts of whoever holds it, but the next ones as well. Patterns revealed themselves, and when someone identifies one, taught the others. In time, patterns that not yet to be seen, remained ignored."

"Some thought their existence was only for what is existed. They brought nothing new but they preserved what is there."

"Their perception was blurry due to their prejudices. They did not accuse themselves or what is taught to them, instead, they denied the reality."

BENCH:

"You can always find someone here. Everyone experiences that moment when you feel you need a break or when your path is blurry. To see from the outside. What do you see?"

- Boundaries.
- A path.
- A choice.
- I'm not sure.

------

BENCH:

"All those people... They are too busy to see the other possibilities. Following the path that is shaped by the predecessors. Did you walk the same way in your life similar to the others?"

- I think so.
- I've had a unique way.
- I'm not sure.

------

BENCH:

"I question the skepticals. We can see what is ahead, then why risk it? Why not trust the predecessors? What do you think, a risky road or one with safe choices?"

- A risky road.
- A safe road.
- In between.
- I'm not sure.

-> A risky road.

"You follow passion, I guess."

-> A safe road.

"That's it."

-> In between.

"Now that is interesting. I never thought this as an option."

-> I'm not sure.

"Think carefully. You look you don't have much time left."

------

BENCH:

"I don't know how many times I've been here to watch they go. What do you call them?"

- Sheep
- Ordinary
- Normal
- Devoted
- I'm not sure.

SILHOUETTE:

"I have a story to share. Would you like to hear?"

- Yes.
- Maybe later.
- No.

-> Maybe later.

"Okay then, I will be around if you change your mind."

-> No.

"Okay then."

-> Yes.

"I've been told for many times, that I am walking on the wrong way. They said, "Why don't you trust the common consciousness?" They always thought happiness comes from being in the flux, walking through it. But in the end, their legacy only helped to restore some stones of the flux. Maybe add some new stones, at most, but that is all. Only so the next ones may be able to walk the exact same way. Doing the same things, saying the same words, judging the others as the way the predecessors did. I responded, "If there is no change, there is no evolution.". When you are inside, you see a continuous change. But if you look at it from the outside, the changes are always the same, like in a loop, therefore flux is stationary. And I had to see the other possibilities, even I would have to do it alone. Because that was my story, not theirs. And I never regret it. Remember, your story is yours, and yours only. Thanks for your listening, I really needed to share it with someone."

------

BENCH:

"People usually don't come here while in your state. I guess you still have some questions. Maybe I can share some advice with you, if you want?"

-> No.

"You want to deal with it alone, I guess. Good luck."

-> Yes.

"What makes us stronger, are our boundaries. We survive as a whole. If one pushes the boundaries too far, become seperated, become alone, and thus, helpless. Flux is not here to restrain us, but to keep us safe and whole. If we need a change, we do it as a whole, just as water that finds its way. I hope this helps. Good luck."

SILHOUETTE:

"Are we here because of our free will or do we follow a deterministic way that we don't have any control on it? What do you think?"

- We have free will.
- Free will is an ilusion.
- I'm not sure.

------

SILHOUETTE:

"Do you think time to time, why we are here? Why do we exist?"

- No, actually.
- Yes, but I don't know why.
- Yes, and I know why.

-> No, actually.

"Leave the cave, someday."

-> Yes, but I don't know why.

"Me neither. Maybe we're here to think that, who knows."

-> Yes, and I know why.

"What do you think it is the reason?"

- A god's wish.
- Cause-and-effects that led up to here.
- Something else.
